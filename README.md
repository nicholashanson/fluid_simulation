## Collision Step

$$
f^{\text{eq}}_q = w_q \rho \left( 1 + \frac{\mathbf{e}_q \cdot \mathbf{u}}{c_s^2} + \frac{(\mathbf{e}_q \cdot \mathbf{u})^2}{2 c_s^4} - \frac{|\mathbf{u}|^2}{2 c_s^2} \right)
$$

Where $w_q$ is the weight in the $q$-th direction, $\rho$ is the fluid density, and $\mathbf{e}_q = (e_{qx}, e_{qy})$ is the discrete velocity vector in the $q$-th direction.
